Análisis de performance\n","- Buenas prácticas de desarrollo\n","- Diseño e implementación de Machine learning en producción\n","\n"," Algunas reglas y recomendaciones:\n"," 1. La mayoría de los ejercicios se piden resolver en Jupyter notebooks y te recomendamos subirlas a un repositorio de GitHub público para compartir los resultados.\n"," 2.
